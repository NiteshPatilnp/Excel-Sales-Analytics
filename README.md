## üöÄ How to Use / Reproduce

1. **Data Preparation**  
   ‚Äì Collect raw sales transactions, target / forecast data, and any metadata (products, customers, markets).  
   ‚Äì Ensure data has consistent formats (dates, numeric fields, category labels).

2. **Power Query & Model Setup**  
   ‚Äì Use Power Query to clean/transform: date tables, fiscal period mapping, merge supplementary tables.  
   ‚Äì Build data model in Power Pivot: connect tables (e.g. Sales ‚Üî Products ‚Üî Customers ‚Üî Markets).

3. **Define Measures / KPIs**  
   ‚Äì Using DAX, create calculated measures: total sales, growth % (period over period), target variance, margin etc.

4. **Build Reports / Dashboards**  
   ‚Äì Design views for different stakeholders: summary dashboards, detailed reports (customer/product/market level).  
   ‚Äì Export to PDF or distribute via Excel if needed.

5. **Iterate & Improve**  
   ‚Äì Solicit feedback, refine visuals, optimize performance.  
   ‚Äì Add new dimensions (e.g. seasonality, promotions) as needed.
